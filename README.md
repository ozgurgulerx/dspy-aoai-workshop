## 🎯 **Workshop Overview**

Welcome to the **DSPy AOAI Workshop**! This hands-on workshop is designed for AI practitioners and developers who want to explore **DSPy**—a revolutionary framework aiming to become the **PyTorch for LLM Programming**. Say goodbye to prompt engineering guesswork and step into a world of structured, programmatic control over large language models.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to harness DSPy’s potential to **enhance Azure OpenAI (AOAI) applications** by creating reusable, modular code that simplifies the way we interact with language models.

## 🌐 **About DSPy**

**DSPy** is an emerging toolset that allows developers to move from prompt-based interactions with language models to a more **programmatic and modular approach**. Just as **PyTorch** revolutionized deep learning workflows, DSPy promises to bring a similar transformation to large language model programming by:
- 📏 Enabling structured programming for model responses
- 🧩 Supporting modular code over complex prompts
- 🎯 Providing a clear separation between intent and implementation
