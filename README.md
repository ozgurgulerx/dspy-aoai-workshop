🎯 Workshop Overview

Welcome to the DSPy on AOAI Workshop! This hands-on workshop is designed for AI practitioners and developers who want to explore DSPy—a revolutionary framework aiming to become the PyTorch for LLM Programming. Say goodbye to prompt engineering guesswork and step into a world of structured, programmatic control over large language models.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to harness DSPy’s potential to enhance Azure OpenAI (AOAI) applications by creating reusable, modular code that simplifies the way we interact with language models.

🌐 About DSPy

DSPy is an emerging toolset that allows developers to move from prompt-based interactions with language models to a more programmatic and modular approach. Just as PyTorch revolutionized deep learning workflows, DSPy promises to bring a similar transformation to large language model programming by:

📏 Enabling structured programming for model responses
🧩 Supporting modular code over complex prompts
🎯 Providing a clear separation between intent and implementation
